## EG+ Coding Challenge

### Task: 

Your challenge is to use the JSON returned from the provided API URL and create an interface which presents the data in a clear manner. This API returns a selection of 15 random users, each with a variety of properties. You may use any tools or frameworks you think are suitable to complete this task. 

Please use the user JSON to construct an HTML table with the following columns:  `Name`, `Date of Birth`, `State` and `Country`. Upon clicking a user's row, display a modal which shows the user's picture and contact information (email, phone/cell numbers). 

API URL to use: https://randomuser.me/api/?results=15&exc=login,info,registered,id&noinfo

### What we are looking for: 

- Clean and organized code (good variable naming, formatting, etc.)
- Responsive design

The appearance and functionality of the site is up to you, and please spend no more than 2-3 hours on this task. Feel free to reach out with any questions or further clarification! 

Upon completion, please return a copy of your source code and a preview link of the site you've created. You are welcome to use any hosting you like, such as [surge.sh](https://surge.sh/), S3, github pages, etc.
